            <p id="instructorTitle"><b>Scott Musick</b><br>Drums & Guitar</p>
            <img id="instructorPhoto" src="Scott.jpg" />
            <p>In 1980, Scott Musick and Michael Been formed The Call and enjoyed much critical and popular success throughout the next decade while being signed to three major record labels in the U.S. and abroad. Scott has also toured the world performing with great artists such as Peter Gabriel, Kris Kristopherson, Elvis Costello, Delbert McClinton, The Band, and many others. Musick's current songs are a departure from the The Call's sound, with a more acoustic based style that winds around Americana to acoustic rock, and even a bit of Gospel.<br><br></p>
