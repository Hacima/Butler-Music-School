# Butler-Music-School
The website for the [Butler Music School](butlermusicschool.com).
I am the designer, and I suppose the webmaster for the school as well as being a teacher here. 
I'm planning on making this website into a hub for our students and instructors. Eventually I would like to add the following: 
- Online tuition payments
- Student accounts so they can sign up for events, communicate with their instructor, etc
- Instructor accounts to organize lesson materials and send students sheet music, notes, and recordings. 
- A calendar to help students and teachers schedule lessons, makeups, and cancellations. 

As of yet, the website is simply HTML and CSS, serving the sole purpose of advertisement. I can't wait to turn it into so much more!
